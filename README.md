# Computer-Architecture-PA-2

**This was the second project assigned in Rutgers 01:198:211 (Computer Architecture).

In this project, I practiced programming more complicated C programs. This includes using header files to organize source code, using and building data structures, and using recursive function calls. At the same time, I reviewed and learned about important graph algorithms found throughout computer science. Below you can find a description of each folder of the programming assignment.

- edgelist: Loading, representing, and printing an undirected unweighted graph
  - Loads an adjacency matrix representation of an undirected unweighted graph, holds that graph representation as an adjacency list data structure, then prints out the edge list representation of the graph.
- isTree: Determining whether an undirected graph is a tree using depth-first search
  - Implements depth-first search through a graph to determine whether the given graph contains a cycle.
- solveMaze: Finding the shortest path through a maze with cycles using breadth-first search
  - Finds the shortest path in a graph from a source node to a destination node using breadth-first search (the graph may contain cycles).
- mst: Finding the minimum spanning tree (MST) of an undirected weighted graph
  - Implements Prim's algorithm to find the MST.
- findCycle: Finding a cycle in a directed graph using depth-first search
  - Finds and prints a cycle in a directed graph. If no cycles are found, the program reports that the graph is a DAG.
